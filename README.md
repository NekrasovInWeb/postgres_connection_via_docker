# docker_postgres_connection
The repository represent how to run your own local PostgreSQL in Docker Container and use it by terminal. That is only for local basics - not for developing enterprise database. 

However the same movements can probably be the keys to understanding how Docker works on your localhost. 

## Docker - what is it??

*Docker* helps developers bring their ideas to life by conquering the complexity of app development.
Basicly the Docker Co making the communty by their own. It is pretty much impressive step to promote your program.

## PostgreSQL ??? 

**PostgreSQL** is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 35 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.

Also has their own community. By the way PostgreSQL is one of the first relational databases. The history of database creation is quite fascinating and interesting. You can read it here link by mark 2.

## What are we going to do? 

Let's imagine that we need to deploy a database and assemble a table with a minimal set of data (1-2 row). Write it to a CSV file, unload it, and then delete the table and the database. Perhaps quite unusual and trivial task awaits us, but it will certainly help us understand the process of running the container in Docker and interact with the database at the level of SQL dialect postgresql.

Before you go into the .sh-file, check out the **plan.md** file, which describes the step-by-step action plan for this sweep. 

*All best and stay safe.*
