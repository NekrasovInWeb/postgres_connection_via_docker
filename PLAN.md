Firstly you need to install the Docker Engine to your localhost. 

You can do it from the web https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
or you could just hit your terminal and use the console whatever: 
  
  *sudo hdiutil attach Docker.dmg
  
  sudo /Volumes/Docker/Docker.app/Contents/MacOS/install
  
  sudo hdiutil detach /Volumes/Docker*
  
This is how you can do it in the terminal on macOS. 

And how Matthew McConaughey says "Alright, Alright, Alright"

Next steps is here: 
   1. open Docker 
   3. run postgres daemon 
   4. get inside the postgres
   5. run db
   6. other stuff 

As you can see this is just a short way of what we will do in the sh-file. 

**If you're interested** in continuing this short path, feel free to look at the file and read the code!
